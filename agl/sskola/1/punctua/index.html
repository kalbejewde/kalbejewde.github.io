<h3>Punctuation</h3>

<p>‹¿Чо таҥ?› «⸘И чо ну таҥ‽» What is all that? Persumably, based on the fact you clicked on the article named 'Punctuation', because you wanted to learn about the punctuation anyways, therefore I will teach you about punctuation.</p>

<h3>. ,</h3>
<p>I don't think I'll need to say too much about these. ‹.› ends a sentence, and ‹,› joins it to another. With ‹,›, you'll want to hold the last vowel for a bit. Many sentences can either join or seperate. For this reason the semi-colon ';' isn't around like it is in english.</p>

<h3>–</h3>
<p>It can link two sentences together like the ‹,›, but without holding the last vowel. You can also use like you would use a colon ':' in english.</p>

<h3>¡! ⸘‽ ¿?</h3>
<p>These serve to convey the energy of a sentence. If the upside-down form is not placed at the start of a sentence, it will slowly change over time to match the energy conveyed by the upright form. ‹¿?› mark questions. ‹¡!› Are used to convey an intense state. ‹⸘‽›, as you might be able to guess, conveys both at once, as ‹¿?› and ‹⸘‽› are simply question related forms of ‹.› and ‹¡!›. As you could maybe put together, you can mix starts and ends to convey a shift in energy through a sentence.</p>

<h3>‹› «»</h3>

<p>This is used to mark quotes from other places. Single forms is used for marking single words or small phrases, whereas the double form is used for marking setences of passages. Anything smaller than a single word will be also marked  with ‹›. These do not cast doubt onto words like it can in english.</p>
