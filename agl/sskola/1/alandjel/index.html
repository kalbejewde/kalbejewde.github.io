<h3>Al and Jel</h3>

<h6>These two words share can do some special things. So let's talk about them!</h6>

<p>In Kalba, words like 'is' 'am', and 'are' don't really exist. You can usually get away with saying the two things you want to pair one after the other. However, some words being put together this can cause confusion. You can place al between them so that people know what you're saying loud and clear.</p>

<p>Al is a good word for keeping things clear. For example, if you say 'Mi poja i lahu', you are saying "We are alert and here". While this is perfectly fine, what is you wanted to be more specific about something? What if you wanted to be less specific about something? You can put 'al' on the front of a word of most any kind to tell that something less direct is meant, including something that a direct read might miss. If you go back and say 'Mi alpoja i allahu', you are now saying "We are awake and ready".</p>

<p>Something to keep in mind is that what we've talked about above, based on when it happened. If it is happening in the time when it is being talked about, or even right now, al will be just fine. But, if you're talking about something that is going to happen, use ula. If something has happened, use lena when it's on its own, or on a verb.</p>

<p>In Kalba, adjectives come before nouns, like they do in English. However, for effect, or to say what was talked about above another way, you can put al at the end of your adjectives and noun. Doing this, the noun comes first, with the adjectives coming after it.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the words in Kalba can't do everything you need them to do. This is where jel comes into play. You can put jel before a non-kalba word to let others know this word isn't in a kalba wordbook.</p>

<p>For all the great things that al does, names are easily greatest. Al' is used to mark out names made from kalba words. As you may be able to guess, Jel' is used to mark out names not made of kalba words.</p>
