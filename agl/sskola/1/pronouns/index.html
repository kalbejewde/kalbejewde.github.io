<p>Take a moment to soak it all in before I explain all of it. The first person is you. The second person is who you're talking to. The third person is who or what you're talking about. As for the column, the first two should be easy to grasp. The third row applies where that person is gendered, but the two above don't apply. This is more common in folksort outside of europe, where the kinds of people go above two. The fourth can be used for a single person of no sort in particular, but is mostly used for describing a small count of people. Likewise the last row is for large groups.</p>

<p>These two have more to explain. Starting with ‹s›, this can be used to make a pronoun note ownership. ‹Je›, on it's own, can mean 'I am...'. As we will discuss in <a href="alijel.html">a later section</a>, you can compare two things by just putting one after the other. Likewise, there are also simple ways to say you have something. If you add ‹s› to the end of a pronoun, ‹Jes› will mean 'I have...' or '...is mine'. As an adjective, it means 'my'.</p>

<p>‹f› Is useful for this as well. While you can say ‹Ja na› for 'I'm in...', or ‹Ja de› for 'I'm from...', you could also say ‹Jaf› instead, or even with those position words, given that's you can be understood, because ‹f› tells us that location is being talked about. Notice how it can allow you to not use position words. At the end of a sentence, say «¡Шум ануҥ яф!», it means "He is coming for me!". It holds the role of clearing up the relation between the subject, who is doing, and the object, who or what is being done unto. Sometimes another object is being done upon, but there is someone who it is for. Here, the ‹f›-having pronoun becomes part of the verb, what is being done. In the book Ал' Сугани Теми there is a snippet that says «Шафу капуҥ шус олен». Word-for-word, this means: "[He] to-her (he-)gave his hand". This would be said in english as "He gave his hand to her". This shows how ‹f› can be used for these kinds of less direct objects.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that these short hand tricks and tools only apply to pronouns. Instead of ‹s›, place ‹gos› after the word when it modifies another word, or use that word as a verb where you would normally. You'll also need to use place words as their verbs as well.</p>
