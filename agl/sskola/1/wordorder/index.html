<h3>Word order</h3>

<h6>You know it's serious when this gets its own section.</h6>

<p>In order to tell people anything useful, you need to put words together in a certain way.
The most common way to do this is using a word order.
There are two very common types of words: Nouns and Verbs!
As you probably learned in school, a verb is a type of word that talks about an action.Came, saw, conquered!
A noun is a word that talks about things, places, people, ideas.
Nouns are set and do not tell of any kind of action on their own. You, dog, sun.
While you may interpret that as "You should take the dog outside to get some sun",
it only says words that don't really have an action in them.
However, there are, for what we're talking about, two kinds of noun.
A subject, is who is doing the action as shown in the verb, and an object, which is who or what the verb is done to.</p>

<h6>In Kalba, the default order of these words is Subject-Verb-Object. That is, it follows a doer-doing-doneto order.
adjectives go before nouns, and adverbs go before verbs.</h6>

<h3>Conjugation Jumpscare</h3>

<table><tr>
<td>У (U)<br>Verb Last</td><td>Е<br>Verb First</td><td>на (na)<br>Reverse Nouns</td>
</tr></table>

<p>The first two, placed always at the head of a sentence, declare that the verb has been pulled to an sentence edge.
The last has the effect of flipping the place of the doer and doneto.
It is analogous to the effect of the passive voice.
There are certain cases where you may use it to analogy with other verbs you may be more familiar with.
What is enjoying someone, besides someone bringing joy to you?, for instance.
A common method to translate 'to like' is ‹напғане›.</p>
