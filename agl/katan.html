<h3>Why Calvic?</h3>
<h6>We are faced with the world in threshold.</h6>
<p>We are faced with a world of escalating war, and instability elsewhere. We are faced with the decline of the American empire, one which could likely itself shatter in the near future, and the rise of a very different power. We are faced with a world where new coalitions are rapidly superceding old ones.</p>
<p>Our world is ever divided. Communication, in many ways, has broken down, even in an age where diplomacy becomes ever more important. We are in a period of history where  moves for change could have pontential to change the world order in drstic ways. We could be very well faced with a world where no-one country holds power, which introduces a whole new question: With what language do we talk to eachother?</p>
<h6>Calvic, as you can assume, is the language I intend to propose for this.</h6>
<h3>What Calvic is:</h3>
<p>Calvic is a nation-neutral language, designed to be of average difficulty or below. Calvic accomplishes this with less than a thousand words, and all complexity in the language serves to allow the laguage to be used in more ways. The word order is highly flexible, with it being possible to rearrage a sentice quite heavily, given you use the right bits of language. This, of course, isn't strictly nessescary, being something done of clarity or artistic flare. Calvic serves to allow disparate nations and languages to communicate with eachother, with as little baggage as can be. Compared to using a language like English, French, Latin, or Chinese, which carries with it the underwritten of their nation's superiority, the nation-neutral Calvic does have this baggage by virtue of being the language of no nation, no faith, and no politic beyond its own. (Alas, it is true, to hold value in a medium with which the whole world may communicate comes with the notion that you belive, to some extent, in worldwide cooperation, which is itself a political position.)</p>
<h3>What Calvic isn't</h3>
<p>Calvic should , <span class="dol">under no circimstances</span>, be used to supercede a local language. Instead, it should be thought of as but another skill; You will speak your local language amongst yourselves, and learn it in school alongside other things like reading, writing, and arithmetic. Calvic should also, <span class="dol">under no circimstances</span>, be spoken as a first language, following the parameters above. For a language to overrule a local langauge, or to even be spoken first and foremost, corropts the nation-neutrality of the language, and constitutes wanton cultracide. Should it ever be in my purvue to regulate such matters, I would prohibit the use of Calvic from being used in programming or media meant for children of less than five years, such is my conviction to this principle.</p>
