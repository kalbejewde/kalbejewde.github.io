<h3>Hello and Goodbye</h3>

<p>If you look for these words in the dictionary, you'll probably only find 'doja'.But there's more going on to this word.
In fact, there's at least four forms of this 'word', and each mean something a little different.</p>

<h6>Доя (doja)</h6>

<p>This is that nice, prim, proper form of the word. It be used as a greeting, but it is primarily used to refer to the
concept of welcomeness, and is the form used as an adjective, and even verbs.
This is how the word will be found in any of calvic's translation dictionaries.</p>

<h6>Дуё (duje)</h6>

<p>The form used in casual greetings. This is the greeting you will recoŋe of you join the KLB-AGL discord linked in the main page.
Alternate forms include: дуј (duj), дој (doj), ој (oj), оя (oja).
This is where it's relatedness to the exlcaimation "oi!" becomes apparent</p>

<h6>Диә (dijo)</h6>

<p>Unlike the rest of them, this serves as an exlaimation of disbeleif at something experienced.
This is similar to the interjective "What?" or "I beg your pardon?".
This can be used also as a generic type of question when you don't know which one to ask.
I would reccomend reading the article on questions before using this.</p>

<h6>Дая (daja)</h6>

<p>Goodbye! Yes, this word can be seen as a functional opposite to duje.
Alternate forms include: дея (deja), деё (deje), дај (daj), даә (dajo).</p>
