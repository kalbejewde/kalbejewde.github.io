<h3>Punctuation</h3>

<p>‹¿Чо таҥ?› «⸘И чо ну таҥ‽» What is all that? Persumably, based on the fact you clicked on the article named 'Punctuation', because you wanted to learn about the punctuation anyways, therefore I will teach you about punctuation.</p>

<h3>. ,</h3>
<p>I don't think I'll need to deliberate too much on these. ‹.› ends a sentence, and ‹,› has it continue. However, many sentences can either join or seperate, and the grammar doesn't nessescarily make this clearer. For this reason the ';' isn't really a thing.</p>

<h3>–</h3>
<p>It marks a pause. This is also used in place of a ':', as it too serves to mark a pause for effect. This is in contrast to the ‹,›, which extends and elongates the last vowel, and also instead for the purpose of linking two sentences.</p>

<h3>¡! ⸘‽ ¿?</h3>
<p>These serve to convey the energy of a sentence. If the inverted form is not placed at the start of a sentence, it will slowly transform into the energy conveyed by the upright form. ‹¿?› mark questions. ‹¡!› Are used to convey an intense emotion. ‹⸘‽›, as you might be able to guess, conveys both in a single punctuation, as ‹¿?› and ‹⸘‽› are simply question forms of ‹.› and ‹¡!›. As you could maybe put together, you can mix starts and ends to convey a shift in energy through a sentence.</p>

<h3>‹› «»</h3>

<p>This is used to mark quotes. Single forms is used for marking single words or small phrases, whereas the double form is used for marking setences of passages. Anything smaller than a single word will be also marked  with ‹›. These quotations do not share the same conotation of casting doubt onto a term.</p>
