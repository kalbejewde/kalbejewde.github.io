<p>This is the full table of standard pronouns in Calvic.
The first person is what you use to talk about yourself.
The Second person person is what you use to talk to someone else.
The third person is what you use to talk about someone else.
Dorume is a standin for systems of gender that go above two,
and per this Langauge's goals of describing the world, it is here.
The row after it are pronouns used either to refer to someone of no specific gender, or a small count, usually five or less.
The final row is then for higher counts, usually more then five.
The choice to have multiple plurals like this was driven by languages that often have more than one degree of plurality.
Due to the fact that there are genderings here that both need adjustment to here, and that lack a good english paralell,
I have elected to Include the full bredth of familial terminology below.</p>

<p id="fis">Now that I've dumped a bunch of somewhat related content on you,
I needed to get to the pronouns to explain the special ways only pronouns can conjugate.
In additionto being able to conjugate for tense as do the verbs,
pronouns have two unique conjugation all to their own.</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>-с (-s)</td>
		<td>-ф (-f)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>possession</td>
		<td>location</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The first, thne the pronoun is used as an adjective, makes it clear that the relation to the noun is that of ownership.
For non pronouns, follow that word with Госи (Gosi).
If used in the noun position, it has the meaning of a 'to have' embedded inside it.
Use Госи (Gosi) as a verb in the lack of a pronoun.
The second turns the sentence into one of location.
Followed by no other locational words, it refers to where the person is in.
This is typically in combination with other location words to clarify,
especially because many location words are too short to be used as verbs.</p>
