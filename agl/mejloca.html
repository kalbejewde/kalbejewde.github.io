<h3>Conjugation</h3>

<p>Mejkrobas! These Mejlociš or wordbits as they're in English, allow us to get far more mileage out of any given word. They stick to either the front or the back of words.</p>

<p>This is an affiliation chart, for denoting stances on matters. Think about, say, the Matters of Socialism. If you break this this word down to its bare compoments, you have 'soc'(see: society) and '-ism', a marker for a method. This can be directly translated as гағиск. To denote an arbitor of socialism, гағискязби would be in order, but you sould remember from <a href="arbi.html">Verbs</a> that the actor's mejloca, ‹-_зби›, does change by gender. It also goes without saying that the verb endings discussed there are a form of mejkrobas, but of course with the special purpose of making the word into a verb.</p>

<p>Addending ‹му-› to an animal word will talk about that animal's meat. Putting ‹шға-› on an animal word will refer to the animal's milk, should it apply. Addending -иә to an animal word will refer to the plant an animal would eat. Doin it like this allows the number of worde to be fewer.</p>

<p>These will need some explanation, since none of these have an english likening. Invocation is used when calling upon, or invoking, someone. To specify means that you ae speaking in the same space as that word, but talking about something more specific. Take ‹poja›, meaning 'alert' or 'alertness'. If we make it into ‹alpoja›, this word now moreso  means 'awake' or 'awakeness'.</p>

<h3 id="mej">Rules about changing words</h3>

<p>If a mejloca and a word both have a vowel where they meet, the vowel from the mejloca will replace the vowel from the base word. In addition, 〈en-al〉 and 〈u-al〉 will become 〈lena〉 and 〈ula〉 instead of 〈enal〉 and 〈ul〉, serving as irregular forms to improve pronunciation, which will change like this even when attached to a word.</p>
