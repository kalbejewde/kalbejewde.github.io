<h3>Azboj</h3>

<p>While 'Alphabet' isn't a 1:1 of 'Azboj', kalbjá azbojaš are the fundamental written units of Calvic. While it's main azboj is cyrillic, or karil azboj, there are three azbojaš.</p>

<h6 id="rmn">Let's begin with román azboj, or kalba romana.</h6>

<p>The first row contains the letters that are used in this azboj, and the second row contains names, which are also words elsewhere, of the letters. Some also have phonics next to them to clarify how to say them. One beg difference is that every letter has only one sound per letter, with the exception of some digraphs. The two letter combinations are there because they show up in the Cyrillic Writing, the primary writing.The numeral 7 is used for a very breif 'hard-pause', which is only heard in the phrase 'uh-oh' in english.</p>

<p>Kalba karila is the primary and default writng system of Calvic. I showed you the Roman form because it would make it easier to teach the Cyrillic form. Try to compare their names to find their correspondent. Now that I have given you both of these, i need to explain the only rule where the sound of letters will be different than their description. The (j) letters (ј я ё ә ю corresponding to j ja je jo ju) have the ability to alter the pronunciation of the letter before them. The first thing it can do is change the pronunciation, and silence the (j).</p>

	<table>

			<td>Before:</td>
			<td>After:</td>

			<td>'psh'</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>щ (st)</td>
			<td>'sht'</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
<p>The second that can happen is that the (j) falls silent with no changes occurring. This is because the combination of sounds suggested simply cannot occur, and accordingly the weakest sound in the cluster is dropped.</p>
	
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>ж (ž)</td>
			<td>ҥ (ŋ)</td>
			<td>ҁ (7)</td>

			<td>ф (f)</td>
			<td>ч (č)</td>
			<td>џ (đ)</td>
			<td>ш (š)</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
<p>The main reasons these need to be specified, especially the second set where it's dropped completely, is because there are a number of suffixes that use and alter the (j) series in the language. This is how karila and romana operate, so what about the third option?</p>

<p>Dolspaŋ is unlike the two above. Firstly, it is written from right to left. Secondly, only consonants get full letters, with vowels being relegated to small markings at the end. Thirdly, many of Calvic's Blends, including the clusters talked about above and their (j)ed forms being depicted through diacritics above it. However, there are no pointers in any computer machine that allows it to be typed, so it only exists in physical writing, with what's present serving as a crude digital depiction.</p>

<p>These were the phonemes determined to be central to the language. The phonemic transcriptions serve mainly as suggestions, a notion probably made apparent by my use of phonics to aid English learners above. Many transcription descisions were suggeasted either convenience of transcription, or for aesthetic preference.</p>
