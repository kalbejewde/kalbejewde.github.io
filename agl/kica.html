<h3>What's in a Name?</h3>

<p>Names are things you name things. Usually, these names work better as names when people agree on names. This is why there's an entire article about it which you are reading. You Might've picked up from <a href="alijel.html">Al and Jel</a> that names have a fair bit going on. There are two types of name, the Calvic name, composed of calvic words and preposed with 〈Ал'〉, the other one foreign names, borrowed from other languages and preposed with ‹Ёл'›.</p>

<p>If you have a name you like, there are two ways to bring it over. Let's take the name 'Madeline' as out reference name. If you peel the name back the name to 'Magdalene' best known from 'Mary of Magdala', of which 'magdala' was the name of a city, from the hebrew word 'migdál', meaning tower, of which there was likely a tower in magdala, near lake Galilee. From this, we will work with the translation 'Lake tower'. From this we can make the name ‹Ал' Пуџену Мацу́›, of which it can also be considered to mean 'lighthouse', due to being a tower near large bodies of water. However, should we want to keep the name intact as an import, since we know the earlist form of it, would become ‹Ёл' Маҥда́л›. The rules that govern what can go next to what are long, but you'll likely get a feel for what allowable (fine, or i'll write another article full of big words only some of you will understand). I would reccomend a tool like wikitionary for digging through to find the meaning of your Name.</p>

<p>Of Course, there is always the option of making your own name for yourself. Make yourself unique by picking your summon for yourself.</p>
