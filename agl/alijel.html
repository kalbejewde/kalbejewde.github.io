<h6>It is so that you will see both of these.</h6>
<h6>You will also see both without that tick to it's right.</h6>
<h6>What does it mean?</h6>

<p>Al(Ал) (I'll get to jel later) is a wordspeck with no meaning unto itself. Therefore, it can stand in for the absence of another verb, which can be absent because 'to be' has no verb to its name; 'to be' is said by saying one after the other. The only non-verbs that can have tense are the pronouns. Therefore, if you need to say a tense when there is no verb, give the tense to al. Know, however, it becomes ‹lena› in the past tense, and ‹ula› in the future tense, and they do not change as the verbs do. Al, when attached to the end of a noun and an adjective reverse the adjective order, placing the noun at the start of the phrase.</p>
<p>There are also some times when you would want to use it alone. Here you may want to use multiple adverbs, but the pillar statement is still a 'to be'. You would put al here to make it easier to follow where the verb ends. This purpose of making the statement clearer has allowed al to be a to be a wordbit, before the word. When it is used this way(ал-), it serves to say that the term is talking about something related to the term that might not be clear from the word alone. However, these words usually will get their own place in the wordbook, but it's something to keep in mind should you see one out in the wild.</p>
<p>The most common form is Al'(Ал'), and this marks a Calvic name. A calvic name is made purely from calvic words.
Anyone strong in calvic should make themselves a Calvic name.</p>
<p>Let us now return to jel. Jel(Ёл), in its plain form, marks a noun as non-Calvic in origin.
Jel'(Ёл') in turn marks a name as non-Calvic in origin. Jel cannot be used as a prefix or in verbs.</p>
