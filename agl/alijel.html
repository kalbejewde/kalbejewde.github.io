<h6>It is a Certainty that you will encounter both of these.</h6>

<h6>What does it mean?</h6>

<p>Al(Ал) (I'll get to jel later) is a particle with no meaning unto itself. Therefore, it can stand in for the absence of another verb, which can be absent because 'to be' has no verb to its name; To be is communicated by stating one after the other. The only non-verbs that can have tense are the pronouns. Therefore, if you need to communicate tense when no verb is present, addend the relevant tense to al. Know, however, that when the past tense is addened, it becomes 'lena' instead.</p>
<p>There are also sometimes when you would want to use it in isolation. In some situations, you may want to use multiple adverbs, but the pillar statement is still a 'to be'. You would put al here to make it easier to follow where the verb ends. This purpose of making the statement clearer has allowed al to be a prefix. When it is used as a prefix(ал-), it serves to communicate that the term is referring to something related to the term used but may not be obvious from the word alone. However, these al-prefixed words usually will get their own different dictionary entries, so it's simply something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>The most frequent use is Al'(Ал'), and this denotes a Calvic name. A calvic name is made almost purely from calvic words. Anyone compotent in the language shoulg get themselves a Calvic name.</p>
<p>Let us now return to jel. Jel(Ёл), in its plain form, marks a noun as non-Calvic in origin. Jel'(Ёл') in turn marks a name as non-Calvic in origin. Jel cannot be used as a prefix or in verbs.</p>
